Here is a list of the files in the Rosalind BioInfo Repo and a brief description of their functions:

1. dnaCount: Counts the number/type of bases in a sequence

2. transcribeDNA2RNA: Transcribes DNA to RNA

3. reverseCompDNA: Returns the reverse compliment of a strand of DNA

4. nFactorial: Returns the factorial of a given number

5. rabbits_recurrence: Calculates Fibinocci sequence with a modifier (allows each element in Fib to produce more than 1 element for the next iteration)

6. mortal_rabbits: Advance Fibinocci calculator for populations and similiar. Allow population to grow by any multiplier and accounts for deaths
